SVN differences:

To display the differences between two paths
usage: diff [-r N:[M]] [TARGET[@REV]...]
*N defaults to BASE if any TARGET is a working copy path, otherwise it must be specified
*M defaults to the current working version if any TARGET is working copy path, 
 otherwise it defaults to HEAD
*TARGETS may be working copy of paths or URLs


Eg: 1. svn diff -r 83:88 BRANCHES/BMPIC_0_0_1dnp/DOC/SVNCL_add.txt
