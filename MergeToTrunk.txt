To merge the working copy (In-Branch) to Trunk:

Look for the histroy of changes made on private copy (working copy) and main line (trunk)

Eg: svn log -v one-trunk/test.txt 
    *working on main line of development
 
     svn log -v two-branch/my-one-branch/test.txt
     *working on private branch

     svn merge -r 15:16 one-trunk/test.txt two-branch/my-one-branch/test.txt
     *The output shows that test.txt was patched .It contains the main line changes 
      - the change has been "copied" from the trunk to the working copy of private branch
      and now exists as a local modification.

     svn commit -m "merged with the trunk"
     *If there is conflict state, it has to be resolved using standard procedure
      1.Merge the conflicted test "by hand" (by examining and editing the conflict markers within the file)
      2.Copy one of the temporary files on top of the working file
      3.Run svn revert <filename> to throw away all local changes 
      4.Once the conflict is resolved do svn commit
